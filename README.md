# RESTFul Flutter Recipe Practice Project

This project is supposed to be a practice project for a RESTFul Flutter application using a Django Backend. The app is supposed to be extremely simple with no authentication logic. The app is only supposed to display a list of recipes from a database and display its information. I am planning to first create the base app after which I will work on making the UI better along with responsiveness and adaptiveness.
